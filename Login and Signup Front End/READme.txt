Back end things that need to be implemented:

    - Reset password needs to send an email to the user (what I tried isn't working),
        this along with the other backend logic needs to be implemented for password
        reset.

    - Login and signup error checks need to be refined for the server

    - Errors with invalid input (not entering anything) for signup
